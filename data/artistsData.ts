      "It was an honor to be involved in both the New Mexican and national art scene through such an incredibly historically important route, one that has led many travelers into our beautiful state. Route 66 has provided travelers a chance to experience the art that has made New Mexico, and the southwest United States, a destination for over a century. However, before Route 66, and before any of us were here, the area was a route for many others. This mural gives us an opportunity to look back to that time, and to, as the buffalo do, come together to face any storm.",

      "Thomas Christopher Haag was born in Wichita, Kansas into a family as vast as the sea.  He took chemistry and math classes for some reason at the university of Kansas and then dropped out and started hitchhiking.  He has lived in southern Mexico, Switzerland, India, Spain, the Pacific Northwest and the great American Southwest.  For the past 20 years, he has been ridiculously involved and obnoxiously in love with the New Mexico art scene, living and working in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Taos.  When he’s had to work, he’s been a commercial diver, propman, art director, low-volume smuggler, curator and gallery owner.  He also once worked for eleven days in a dog food factory where they made Kibbles’ n Bits, but he prefers to paint.  An avid muralist, both commissioned and not, he has painted buildings in Oaxaca, Barcelona, Venice, Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Varanasi, Bangkok, Rangoon, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Oakland and many other places, under the names “Detach”, “Stove” and “El Pituitario”. \nUsing “reclaimed” house paint taken from chemical disposal facilities, found wood, and discarded books, he constructs multi-layered, collaged paintings and assemblages which reference ancient cultures and spiritual traditions, but with just a hint of smart-ass.  Homages to criminal saints, a bodhisattva telling a fart joke, events of divine banality and cosmic significance, stripped of pretense or stuffed with it.  Either way, it is all holy s#*!.",

      "Commissioned for Route 66's centennial celebration, Betsch's vinyl wrap design for Albuquerque's ART buses transforms public transit into a mobile canvas honoring the historic highway's relationship with the city.\n\nThe design addresses Route 66's dual significance as both nostalgic symbol and contemporary cultural anchor. Sunrise and sunset themes on opposite sides explore this duality, with each side representing different aspects of the highway's legacy. The bus's architecture becomes integral to the composition, with windows and doors functioning as framing devices that create portals into Albuquerque's visual culture.\n\nThe passenger side features preserved neon signage from Central Avenue, arranged geographically east to west. The driver's side showcases fellow Route 66 Centennial artists' work within window frames. Albuquerque's car culture—from lowriders to classic Americana vehicles—is positioned to integrate with the bus's wheel wells, acknowledging the bus as a functional vehicle within the city's traffic flow.\n\nAs the bus travels Central Avenue's 18-mile stretch, it serves both as transportation to Route 66 Centennial installations and as moving artwork connecting communities along this historic highway.",

      "The Mother Road Cruise, a vinyl mural wrap around the Rosenwald Building windows located in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico, the only place in the country where the original route intersects with the newer one. \n\nInspired by downtown Albuquerque’s lowrider cruising culture, the land, and the local communities that are rooted here, I created an art piece that narrates how Mother Earth crafted a highway linking communities through travel and culture from the dawn of time into the future. \n\nThe art begins in front of the Rosenwald building, facing Central Avenue, featuring an indigenous woman who represents the Sandia Mountains, turning into the sky and plants, to honor the ancestral land, its people, and traditions. The coyote and horses, part of the beginning of time, start the cruise. Inspired by my Mexican heritage, I depict them as alebrijes—vividly colored, fantastical animals that serve as spiritual guides or protectors. \n\nThe first motorized transportation I designed on the cruise was the train, following the development of the road that became Route 66. The artwork tracks the route around the building on 4th Street and explores the 1960s and 1970s Route 66 culture. The cruise then honors the Albuquerque downtown lowrider Sunday cruise and its community, celebrating how lowriders have united families across generations in New Mexico. Finally, the cruise ventures out of Albuquerque into the future, symbolically traveling into space. \n\nIn the artwork designs, butterflies are shown moving through the scene symbolizing the migration of animals and humans. The rainbow signifies the LGBTQIA+ community, while roses and the landscape are incorporated to link various time periods, peoples, and cultures. \n\nI use Adobe Illustrator to create the artwork and scale it to a large size, which allows me to modify each window image. I worked with a local printing company, Arts & Advertising Signs, to print on perforated vinyl, a special kind of film with tiny holes that allow people to see inside while still displaying a vibrant graphic on the outside.",

      '"Cultural Crossroads"\n\nThis mural, "Cultural Crossroads," celebrates the rich cultural heritage of the Indigenous communities through which Route 66 passes, acknowledging the iconic American road that connects and intersects with diverse cultures and communities. \n\nRoute 66 weaves through the ancestral lands of numerous Native American tribes, its path intertwined with the stories, traditions, and histories of the region\'s Indigenous peoples. This region of Route 66 intersects with many Indigenous ancestral homelands, those of the many Pueblos communities who live along the Rio Grande, as well as the Navajo (Diné), and Apache. \n\nThe title "Cultural Crossroads" reflects the intersection of cultures, traditions, and histories that converge along Route 66, a mixture of Native American, Southwestern, American, Chicano, Mexican, and Spanish influences.\n\nBy weaving together Navajo (Diné) rug inspired designs, ancestral Pueblo landscapes, and vibrant depictions of everyday life, this artwork brings to life the stories and traditions of the land\'s original inhabitants. The incorporation of Navajo-inspired geometric patterns in the background create a portal designed of Native heritage, New Mexico colors, and Route 66 themes.\n\nThe mural depicts a Navajo (Diné) rider on horseback amidst Southwestern flora like cacti and sunflowers, juxtaposed with a vintage car traveling down Route 66. The Route 66 sign in the mural serves as a symbol of the historic highway\'s impact on the American Southwest and Indigenous communities. The vintage car represents the travelers and adventurers who journeyed along this iconic route, interacting with and influencing the local cultures they encountered. The Navajo rider on horseback embodies the enduring spirit and traditions of the Native American communities, who have lived on this land for centuries. The juxtaposition of these elements invites the viewer to consider the complex history and cultural exchanges that have shaped the region.\n\nThis artwork is a celebration of the intersection of cultures, traditions, and histories that make the Southwest region of Route 66 so unique. It is an invitation to explore, learn, and appreciate the beauty and complexity of Native American communities, and to recognize the important role that Route 66 plays in shaping our shared cultural identity. By engaging with this mural, viewers are encouraged to consider the multiple narratives and histories that intersect along Route 66, fostering a deeper appreciation for the cultural richness of the region. \n\n-By Lynnette Haozous, 2025.',

Transforming this tropical plant into something that looks like it belongs to Albuquerque's unique visual language is a metaphor for myself. Having grown up here, but being from different cultures, I often feel simultaneously ingrained into this distinct landscape and culture, but also like I do not really belong. Accompanied with the visual piece is an audio artwork that features excerpts from an interview with my mom Vilma Atkins, a Venezuelan immigrant who moved to New Mexico in 1985. In it she speaks to the cultural significance of Plantain Trees in Venezuela; mentioning the Christmas tradition of making Hallacas (similar to tamales in New Mexico), and the health benefits of the plantain leaves. While this piece is unique to my heritage and family, it is also meant to be a touch point for many. Plantain trees grow across equatorial regions and are integral to cuisines in SouthEast Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and South America.

Through layered oil technique and reflective materials, he harnesses and refracts illumination—inviting viewers to contemplate transformation, endurance, and the unseen forces that give life its radiance.\n\nBarnett’s work continues to expand nationally, appearing in exhibitions and private collections.
