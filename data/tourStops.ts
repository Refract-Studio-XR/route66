    artistStatement: `In this immersive installation, I explore the intersection of memory and urban spaces. The work draws from my experiences growing up in rapidly changing cityscapes, where the familiar transforms into the unknown overnight.

Through the use of augmented reality, viewers are invited to witness the layered history of this space. Each interaction reveals a new dimension of the story, challenging our perception of what was, what is, and what could be.

The piece incorporates found objects from demolished buildings in the area, each carrying its own narrative and emotional weight. These artifacts serve as anchors, connecting the digital elements to the physical reality of the space.

By merging traditional sculptural elements with cutting-edge technology, this installation creates a dialogue between past and present, physical and digital, memory and reality. The viewer becomes an active participant in this exploration, their movements and choices shaping their unique experience of the work.`,

    artistStatement: `This piece examines the digital footprints we leave behind in physical spaces. Through augmented reality, visitors encounter ethereal traces of past interactions, creating a living, breathing archive of human presence.

The installation uses machine learning to analyze movement patterns and translate them into visual poetry. Each visitor's journey through the space adds to an ever-evolving digital tapestry, visible only through the lens of technology.

Sound plays a crucial role in this work, with spatial audio creating invisible boundaries and pathways. The audio landscape shifts and adapts based on collective movement patterns, creating a dynamic soundscape that reflects the organic flow of human traffic.

This exploration of digital permanence in physical impermanence raises questions about memory, surveillance, and the nature of shared spaces in our increasingly connected world.`,
