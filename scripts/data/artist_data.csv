10,Thomas Christopher Haag,,Artist," 
It was an honor to be involved in both the New Mexican and national art scene through such an incredibly historically important route, one that has led many travelers into our beautiful state. Route 66 has provided travelers a chance to experience the art that has made New Mexico, and the southwest United States, a destination for over a century. However, before Route 66, and before any of us were here, the area was a route for many others. This mural gives us an opportunity to look back to that time, and to, as the buffalo do, come together to face any storm.","Thomas Christopher Haag was born in Wichita, Kansas into a family as vast as the sea.  He took chemistry and math classes for some reason at the university of Kansas and then dropped out and started hitchhiking.  He has lived in southern Mexico, Switzerland, India, Spain, the Pacific Northwest and the great American Southwest.  For the past 20 years, he has been ridiculously involved and obnoxiously in love with the New Mexico art scene, living and working in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Taos.  When he’s had to work, he’s been a commercial diver, propman, art director, low-volume smuggler, curator and gallery owner.  He also once worked for eleven days in a dog food factory where they made Kibbles’ n Bits, but he prefers to paint.  An avid muralist, both commissioned and not, he has painted buildings in Oaxaca, Barcelona, Venice, Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Varanasi, Bangkok, Rangoon, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Oakland and many other places, under the names “Detach”, “Stove” and “El Pituitario”. 
Using “reclaimed” house paint taken from chemical disposal facilities, found wood, and discarded books, he constructs multi-layered, collaged paintings and assemblages which reference ancient cultures and spiritual traditions, but with just a hint of smart-ass.  Homages to criminal saints, a bodhisattva telling a fart joke, events of divine banality and cosmic significance, stripped of pretense or stuffed with it.  Either way, it is all holy s#*!.

14,Dante Tsuzuki Betsch,He/Him,Artist,"Commissioned for Route 66's centennial celebration, Betsch's vinyl wrap design for Albuquerque's ART buses transforms public transit into a mobile canvas honoring the historic highway's relationship with the city.

The design addresses Route 66's dual significance as both nostalgic symbol and contemporary cultural anchor. Sunrise and sunset themes on opposite sides explore this duality, with each side representing different aspects of the highway's legacy. The bus's architecture becomes integral to the composition, with windows and doors functioning as framing devices that create portals into Albuquerque's visual culture.

The passenger side features preserved neon signage from Central Avenue, arranged geographically east to west. The driver's side showcases fellow Route 66 Centennial artists' work within window frames. Albuquerque's car culture—from lowriders to classic Americana vehicles—is positioned to integrate with the bus's wheel wells, acknowledging the bus as a functional vehicle within the city's traffic flow.

As the bus travels Central Avenue's 18-mile stretch, it serves both as transportation to Route 66 Centennial installations and as moving artwork connecting communities along this historic highway.
","Dante Tsuzuki Betsch is a multimedia communications designer based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Born in Taos and raised in Albuquerque, Betsch's work centers on community engagement, informed by his experiences working across the globe.

Classically trained in textile design with a background in illustration, Betsch's practice spans multiple disciplines and scales. His methodology emphasizes tactile processes and community collaboration.

6,Travis Bruce Black,He,Artist,"Mother: Moment is a composition between artists Noe Barnett and Travis Bruce Black to serve the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Route 66. In the piece a woman (Noe’s mom, Albuquerque Resident) indulges a moment to remember her adventures on Route66, the sights, the sounds and the feelings.
In the act of remembering a virtual space is birthed. The mind is a flower expanding outward. This work is a simulated portal containing her memory, bearing witness to the joys of a trip through Albuquerque on the Mother Road.  On the trip a purple Impala pulled to the side of the road, a Wolf siting, a lucky roadrunner, and a moment of catching air in the Station Wagon.

8,Gael Luna,They/Them,Artist,"The Mother Road Cruise, a vinyl mural wrap around the Rosenwald Building windows located in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico, the only place in the country where the original route intersects with the newer one. 

Inspired by downtown Albuquerque’s lowrider cruising culture, the land, and the local communities that are rooted here, I created an art piece that narrates how Mother Earth crafted a highway linking communities through travel and culture from the dawn of time into the future. 

The art begins in front of the Rosenwald building, facing Central Avenue, featuring an indigenous woman who represents the Sandia Mountains, turning into the sky and plants, to honor the ancestral land, its people, and traditions. The coyote and horses, part of the beginning of time, start the cruise. Inspired by my Mexican heritage, I depict them as alebrijes—vividly colored, fantastical animals that serve as spiritual guides or protectors. 

The first motorized transportation I designed on the cruise was the train, following the development of the road that became Route 66. The artwork tracks the route around the building on 4th Street and explores the 1960s and 1970s Route 66 culture. The cruise then honors the Albuquerque downtown lowrider Sunday cruise and its community, celebrating how lowriders have united families across generations in New Mexico. Finally, the cruise ventures out of Albuquerque into the future, symbolically traveling into space. 

In the artwork designs, butterflies are shown moving through the scene symbolizing the migration of animals and humans. The rainbow signifies the LGBTQIA+ community, while roses and the landscape are incorporated to link various time periods, peoples, and cultures. 

I use Adobe Illustrator to create the artwork and scale it to a large size, which allows me to modify each window image. I worked with a local printing company, Arts & Advertising Signs, to print on perforated vinyl, a special kind of film with tiny holes that allow people to see inside while still displaying a vibrant graphic on the outside.

0,Hakim Bellamy,He/Him,Poet and Narrative Consultant,"The thing about portals...past, present, or future (read: prospective) ... is that ""the before,"" ""the now,"" and ""the next"" share one thing in common: our participation.

Like our memory of ourselves at different stops along Historic Route 66 at different times in our lives, our parents and grandparent's lives, our children and grandchildren's lives. And just as these various memories of travel and place merge to find a home in our minds, our bodies also remember. Our bodies retain the muscular and material memory of all of the places and times we have been. The body is a portal, though it is rarely the destination.

9,Lynnette Haozous,She,Artist,"""Cultural Crossroads""

This mural, ""Cultural Crossroads,"" celebrates the rich cultural heritage of the Indigenous communities through which Route 66 passes, acknowledging the iconic American road that connects and intersects with diverse cultures and communities. 

Route 66 weaves through the ancestral lands of numerous Native American tribes, its path intertwined with the stories, traditions, and histories of the region's Indigenous peoples. This region of Route 66 intersects with many Indigenous ancestral homelands, those of the many Pueblos communities who live along the Rio Grande, as well as the Navajo (Diné), and Apache. 

The title ""Cultural Crossroads"" reflects the intersection of cultures, traditions, and histories that converge along Route 66, a mixture of Native American, Southwestern, American, Chicano, Mexican, and Spanish influences.

By weaving together Navajo (Diné) rug inspired designs, ancestral Pueblo landscapes, and vibrant depictions of everyday life, this artwork brings to life the stories and traditions of the land's original inhabitants. The incorporation of Navajo-inspired geometric patterns in the background create a portal designed of Native heritage, New Mexico colors, and Route 66 themes.

The mural depicts a Navajo (Diné) rider on horseback amidst Southwestern flora like cacti and sunflowers, juxtaposed with a vintage car traveling down Route 66. The Route 66 sign in the mural serves as a symbol of the historic highway's impact on the American Southwest and Indigenous communities. The vintage car represents the travelers and adventurers who journeyed along this iconic route, interacting with and influencing the local cultures they encountered. The Navajo rider on horseback embodies the enduring spirit and traditions of the Native American communities, who have lived on this land for centuries. The juxtaposition of these elements invites the viewer to consider the complex history and cultural exchanges that have shaped the region.

This artwork is a celebration of the intersection of cultures, traditions, and histories that make the Southwest region of Route 66 so unique. It is an invitation to explore, learn, and appreciate the beauty and complexity of Native American communities, and to recognize the important role that Route 66 plays in shaping our shared cultural identity. By engaging with this mural, viewers are encouraged to consider the multiple narratives and histories that intersect along Route 66, fostering a deeper appreciation for the cultural richness of the region.

3,Helen Juliet Atkins,she/her,Artist,"Neon Plátano honors the plantain tree with a classic route 66 neon aesthetic. Transforming this tropical plant into something that looks like it belongs to Albuquerque's unique visual language is a metaphor for myself. Having grown up here, but being from different cultures, I often feel simultaneously ingrained into this distinct landscape and culture, but also like I do not really belong. Accompanied with the visual piece is an audio artwork that features excerpts from an interview with my mom Vilma Atkins, a Venezuelan immigrant who moved to New Mexico in 1985. In it she speaks to the cultural significance of Plantain Trees in Venezuela; mentioning the Christmas tradition of making Hallacas (similar to tamales in New Mexico), and the health benefits of the plantain leaves. While this piece is unique to my heritage and family, it is also meant to be a touch point for many. Plantain trees grow across equatorial regions and are integral to cuisines in SouthEast Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and South America. And so, Neon Plátano is a way-finder for the many immigrants to Albuquerque, who find a piece of their home at Talin Market.","Helen Juliet Atkins is a New Mexico-based artist and curator whose work centers humanity; its resilience, contradictions, and collective memory. Born in Albuquerque to a Black Venezuelan mother and White American father, her biracial heritage informs her multidisciplinary practice, which spans multimedia installations and community-engaged projects.

6,Noé Barnett,,Artist,,"Noé Barnett is a muralist and painter whose work infuses both streets and gallery walls with life through color, realism, and light. A native of Albuquerque, New Mexico, Barnett’s roots have shaped his grounded yet transcendent approach to art. With a growing reputation as a leading figure in contemporary muralism, he has transformed public spaces across the country—turning walls into living conversations that reflect the spirit of their communities.

Barnett’s murals are more than decoration; they are dialogues in light, form, and emotion—using color to spark reflection, connection, and renewal. As he transitions further into the fine art realm, Barnett carries forward the same ethos that defines his street work: art as a catalyst for awareness and encounter.

His studio paintings extend this dialogue inward, exploring light as both subject and metaphor. Through layered oil technique and reflective materials, he harnesses and refracts illumination—inviting viewers to contemplate transformation, endurance, and the unseen forces that give life its radiance.

Barnett’s work continues to expand nationally, appearing in exhibitions and private collections. Whether on a public wall or a gallery canvas, his art invites pause and perception—a call to see not just the world around us, but the light within it.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MOEtOqmJTEYL_E9PxkCnXjnOF1xOs9NA,Nope,nbartistry.com,IG: nb.artistry youtube - NB Aritstry
